# Analog-Clock-Project
This project is a functional analog clock built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It visually represents time with an elegant clock face, featuring smoothly moving hour, minute, and second hands. The clock dynamically updates in real-time using JavaScript's setInterval() function to fetch the current time and rotate the hands accordingly.
